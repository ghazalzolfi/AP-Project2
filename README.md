This project is about developing an international online store as part of the "Advanced Programming" course.
The project involves both frontend and backend development using Flask framework on the server side and HTML/CSS on the client side.

Key Features:
1. Main Page: Displays products with images, names, and prices. The price should be shown in both local currency and **USD**, based on the current exchange rate. Users can add products to their cart.
2. Product Form: Allows users to add products by entering the product name, image (or image URL), and price. The image can either be uploaded to a database or linked externally.
3. Shopping Cart: A separate page where users can view and manage their selected products. It should display the total cost in both local currency and USD, with an option to finalize the order (though this does not need to perform any real functionality).
